The conversion rates between currencies are predefined within the JavaScript code. The application uses these rates to perform real-time currency conversion based on user input.

Select the source currency from the "From Currency" dropdown menu.
Select the target currency from the "To Currency" dropdown menu.
Click the "Convert" button to see the converted amount.
Note: While this project uses predefined conversion rates for simplicity, a real-world application might fetch up-to-date exchange rates from an external API.
